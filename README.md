# Function Plotter

Plots a function `y = f(x)` over an interval, using a canvas element.  
One of my early attempts at learning the API for HTML5 Canvas elements.

The function to plot is received as an argument, together with the interval of domain values (`x`).

Calculates the range values (`y`), and it scales `x` and `y` values so they accommodate the entire width and height of the canvas.

Uses `sine()` and `cosine()` as examples of input functions.
